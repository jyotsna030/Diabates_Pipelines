# Minor Project: Healthcare Data Analysis Pipeline

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive data pipeline and performing analysis on a healthcare dataset. The dataset includes various features like health conditions, lifestyle choices, and demographic details, aiming to derive actionable insights for public health.

## Project Description

The `Minor_Project.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the following:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for a large healthcare dataset (500,000 rows).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
- Utilization of advanced Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, inconsistent data types, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generates statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover trends.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Flexible for adapting to different healthcare datasets.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains features such as:
- `Diabetes_012`: Diabetes diagnosis (binary values).
- `HighBP`, `HighChol`: Blood pressure and cholesterol indicators.
- `BMI`, `PhysActivity`, `Smoker`: Lifestyle metrics.
- Demographic details like `Age`, `Sex`, `Education`, and `Income`.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (optional, for future model-building steps)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minor-project.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Minor_Project.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells sequentially to see the pipeline in action.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Interactive dashboards for real-time insights.
- Extending support for other healthcare datasets.
